really bad passcode lock plugin for ***cord

inspired by arg0NNY's PasscodeLock plugin for BetterDiscord


### stuff

only locks discord when theres a passcode (set in settings)

locks discord when it first starts up (might make a setting to disable this)
lock discord manually with F12

to unlock type in your passcode and it will automatically unlock when its fully typed in

i recommend a simple passcode
